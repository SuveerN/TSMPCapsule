# TSMPCapsule
A Capsule for the HPE NonStop TS/MP runtime environment

TSMPCapsule is an extension of Capsule (http://www.capsule.io), aka Caplet, for the HPE NonStop TSMP runtime environment. The caplet can configure the TSMP runtime environment components such as Pathmon and the Serverclass. Needless to say the caplet functions only on the HPE NonStop OS environment
